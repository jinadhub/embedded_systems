- They interract with a user via simple interface e.g digital camera, TV, cell phone 
- They do not interract directly wth a user but through another user device e.g external storage disk, flash drive 
- Efficiency is very important e.g fast,low power, cheaper when it comes to embedded systems 
	- Most embedded products are in cost-critical markets
	- Other applicatins are in performance or power critical markets e.g military, medical 


	TIGHT CONTRAINTS 
	- Manufacturing cost
	- Design cost
	- Performance
	- Power
	- Time-to-market 

HOW Embedded systems are designed 

	- ES tend to ne application-specific i.e performs one task or set of related tasks 
		- SOme devices blur the line e.g cell phones 
	- Application specificity 
		- design focused on one application -- unlike general purpose systems e.g laptops 
		- higher design efficiency is possible 
			- special-purpose vs general purpose
	- Hardware/Software Codesign  
	  HW and SW are often designed together
		- general purpose systems use hardware and software develooped by different companies  or vendors 
		- more work for designers as you have to known the hardware in order to build the right software that is compactible 

GENERIC EMBEDDED SYSTEMS STRUCTURE 
	-sensors: (take data from outside world)
	-ADC
	-Microcontrollers(IP FPGA)
		IP: Intellectual property core are very useful for common tasks such as 
			- network controllers (ethernet, CAN)
			- Audio/video (audio codec, VGA controllers)
		IP must interract with microcontroller 
			- consider communication protocol 
		FPGA: Field programmable Gate Array
			- hardware that can be configured via RAM
				-faster than SW, slower than ASIC 
			        - No fabrication needed 
		FPGA cheaper than IP Core

	-Actuators 

MICROCONTROLLERS 

 - Integrated circuit that excutes a program 
    - Microcontrollers vs microprocessor 
        microcontroller reads inputs from other components and control other components 
            - slower, 16MHz - 500MHz
            - less memory, fewer features 
    - Microcontrollers are less powerful than microprocessor(heavy duty, fast)
    - Microcontrollers need to be programmed such as C and place the programme in mctrlr memory

    Programming microcontrollers 
    - Write code on a host machine - regular desktop or laptop
    - Programming the microcontroller - transferring the programme from host to microcontroller 

    Adduio - program in C 
    raspberrypi - program in python 
  - code is compiled amd shipping to the microcontroller 

   - Adduio and raspberrypi are programmed by pluging them with a usb to a computer. 



    - Development board 

Categories of processors: general purpose vs digital single processors

-General purpose processors e.g laptops, desktop:
    - used for many applications 
    - More powerful 
    - more expensive 

- Digital signal processors 
    - Made to suppoer DSP functions such as audio streams, video streams, 
    - Vector instructions: do the same thing to different data 
    - Cheaper but more limited 

SENSORS
 - They receive information from the environment 
 - Provide simple information
 - Examples of simple sensors (supply simple outputs real numbers) include:
    - Thermistor: reports temperature 
    - Photoresistor: reports light intensity 
- Complex sensors:
    -More complicated data
    - Examples:
        - CMOS camera: captures images 
        - Ethernet controller: enables network communication


ACTUATORS
 - Cause events to occur in the environment
 - Simple actuators;
    - Light-Emtting Diodes(LED) - small lights
    - LCD Displat: simple display 

- Complex Actuators:
    - Servp motors: moves something, changing angles for example in robots
    - Ethernet controller: enables network communication 


Lecture 3.1 Analog/Digital Conversion 

- Sensors are sensing physical phenomenon which are often analog signals. real numbers (have fractions) integers (no fractions) 

- Converts analog data to digital data 
- Used to interface with analog sensors. 
- Lighting and sound are example of analog phenomenon because, you can varyin levels of brightneess/dimness between 
  completely off and completely dark; sound: completely loud and completely low/mute. 

- Digital are like integer numbers and analog are like real numbers

- Miconttrollers are digital sensors understands 0 and 1 binary
- Thus for our programme on microsontrollers to be able to use information from sensors, that analog signal has been
  converted into a digital value. That is what analog->digital conversion is for


Output end: Digital to Analog conversion 
- converts digital signals to analogs signals 
- used interface with analog actuators
- for example: 
	microsontrollers -> signals to a speaker(analog device, hence needs analog signals)
	- microcontrollers outputs 0s and 1s, hence they need to be converted into analog signals 
Hence, it is very common to used:
		- digital -> analog conversion for output systems
		- analog -> digital conversion for input signals 




-Lecture 3.2: Basic Equipment 
   
	- Development board with a microcontroller (Adduio)
	- connectors: usb, ethernet cable, jumper wires
	- Input: Potentiiometer,Photoresistor, Keypad, buttons
	- Output: LEDs
	- Others: Resistors, Breadboard
	BREADBOARD is for wiring; 
		-used for fast, non-permanent wiring
		- Holes fir 24guage wire and, 0.1 inch spacing
		- common prototyping sizes
