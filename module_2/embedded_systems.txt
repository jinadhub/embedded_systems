- They interract with a user via simple interface e.g digital camera, TV, cell phone 
- They do not interract directly wth a user but through another user device e.g external storage disk, flash drive 
- Efficiency is very important e.g fast,low power, cheaper when it comes to embedded systems 
	- Most embedded products are in cost-critical markets
	- Other applicatins are in performance or power critical markets e.g military, medical 


	TIGHT CONTRAINTS 
	- Manufacturing cost
	- Design cost
	- Performance
	- Power
	- Time-to-market 

HOW Embedded systems are designed 

	- ES tend to ne application-specific i.e performs one task or set of related tasks 
		- SOme devices blur the line e.g cell phones 
	- Application specificity 
		- design focused on one application -- unlike general purpose systems e.g laptops 
		- higher design efficiency is possible 
			- special-purpose vs general purpose
	- Hardware/Software Codesign  
	  HW and SW are often designed together
		- general purpose systems use hardware and software develooped by different companies  or vendors 
		- more work for designers as you have to known the hardware in order to build the right software that is compactible 

GENERIC EMBEDDED SYSTEMS STRUCTURE 
	-sensors: (take data from outside world)
	-ADC
	-Microcontrollers(IP FPGA)
		IP: Intellectual property core are very useful for common tasks such as 
			- network controllers (ethernet, CAN)
			- Audio/video (audio codec, VGA controllers)
		IP must interract with microcontroller 
			- consider communication protocol 
		FPGA: Field programmable Gate Array
			- hardware that can be configured via RAM
				-faster than SW, slower than ASIC 
			        - No fabrication needed 
		FPGA cheaper than IP Core

	-DAC	
	-Actuators
